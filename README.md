### VBA_Challenge

VBA code created to run nested "for Loops" with conditionals to generate a summary table, which includes color formatting. Summary table is created from provided "stock prices" data.


Side Note: This assignment challenged me more than I thought it would. I strove to have the "perfect" code, with no errors, and that drive had me going crazy. I ended up with so many different code files because I couldn't accept that I was decimal points off the correct answers or it didn't loop the way I wanted it to. I used a previous version and slowly added tweaks. Once I saw the changes I wanted, I went a little further to clean up the order and my "notes" in the code. Finally, when I got to adding the part of the code which requires looping through all worksheets, I couldn't believe it worked. Of course, none of those are added into this repository, but I've definitely learned that patience, some sugar, and tweaking a code from the point where it works "good enough" is how to navigate such blocks.
